# sweet-mockito

A small library to help you (or not) with Mockito + Scala3 + ZIO (I think it is possible Cats-Effect as well).

## I love Scalmock, but it's not available for Scala 3 yet.

This library aims to help a little with Mockito. I have decided to publish it because it helped me with a small project that  I have been working on.

The following examples use ZIO, Try, Either and Option as Effect types.
