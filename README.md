# sweet-mockito
A small library to help you (or not) with Mockito + Scala3 and ZIO.

## I love Scalmock, but it's not available for Scala 3 yet.

This library aims to help a little with Mockito. I have decided to publish it because it helped me with a small project which I have been working on for now.
